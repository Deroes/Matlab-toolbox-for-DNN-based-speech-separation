## Matlab toolbox for DNN-based speech separation
This folder contains Matlab programs for a toolbox for supervised speech separation using deep neural networks (DNNs). This toolbox is composed by Jitong Chen, based on an earlier version written by Yuxuan Wang. The toolbox is further improved by Yuzhou Liu. 

For technical details about DNN-based speech separation see the following paper:

The toolbox is provided by the OSU Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL).
